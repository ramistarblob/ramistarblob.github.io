I'm a second year Astronomy PhD student at Yale University! My research broadly focuses on star and planet formation, as well as physical/chemical processes in the interstellar medium. I use instruments such as ALMA, SMA, and JWST to probe the protostellar environment, analyzing molecular outflows from young stars as well as their nascent protoplanetary/circumstellar disks.
