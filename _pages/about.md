I'm a second-year Astronomy PhD student at Yale University! My research broadly focuses on star and planet formation, as well as physical/chemical processes in the interstellar medium. I use instruments such as ALMA, SMA, and JWST to probe the protostellar environment, such as molecular outflows from young stars as well as protoplanetary/circumstellar disks.

I graduated from William & Mary in 2024 with a B.S. in Physics and minor in English. Outside of Astromomy, I love reading fantasy/sci-fi novels (check out my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40674764-indigo-ramisa">goodreads</a>), listening to music, eating spicy food, and hiking :)!
